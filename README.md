# Ember-material-design

The **Ember Material Design** project is an implementation of Material Design in EmberJS. This project 
attempts to provide a set of reusable, well-tested and accessible UI components based on the Material Design system.

This project is as close to a reference implementation of [Angular Material](http://material.angularjs.org) as 
I could make it. Most of the credit for this work belongs to that team.

## Demo
