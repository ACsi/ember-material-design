    <p>The <strong>Ember Material Design</strong> project is an implementation of Material Design in EmberJS. This
        project provides a set of reusable, well-tested and accessible UI
        components based on the Material Design system.</p>

    <p>
        This project is as close to a reference implementation of <a href="http://material.angularjs.org">Angular
        Material</a> as I could make it.

    <p>
        Follow the project on <a href="https://github.com/mike1o1/ember-material-design">GitHub</a>. Any and all
        feedback is welcome!

    <h2 class="md-title">What is Material Design?</h2>

    <p>
        <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/">Material Design</a> is a specification for a
        unified system of visual, motion, and interaction design that adapts across different devices and different
        screen sizes.

        Below is a brief video that presents the Material Design system:
